Our team has been working on open source products with zero trust security, but we found that although many zero trust network security companies provide zero trust security platforms, they monopolize users\u0026rsquo; network access nodes and centrally store users\u0026rsquo; core security profiles. Therefore, we are considering whether we can use web3 technology to realize a secure network for private data retrieval. We designed CloudSlit project to provide users with a decentralized secure network platform for private data retrieval, and help users master their own secure data.\nIts value # CloudSlit aims to build a decentralized private data retrieval security network system of web3 in the world, and help users recapture the privacy security information eroded by giants under web2, so that the current global hot zero-trust security network technology combined with web3 can better help users master their own security privacy data and give users a good experience of private data retrieval security network products.\nHow do we build it? # The design part of CloudSlit project includes distributed full-nodes, network miner provider, intelligent contract, network quality checker and network client program. The details are as follows:\nPart Ⅰ: CloudSlit-Fullnode (Ful nodes of private data retrieval network based on DAO Tools) # Anyone can run Fullnode, which hosts the metadata of decentralized network and provides metadata networking and transaction matching platform. It integrates metadata from all providers, and providers use libp2p-based pubsub every few seconds to keep heartbeat to Fullnode to prove that they are online.\nUsers can find resources and nodes to build their own secure anonymous network tunnel. They only need to pay some tokens, and the provider nodes can get these tokens as rewards.\nFor all users\u0026rsquo; and Dao\u0026rsquo;s data, we use Filecoin\u0026rsquo;s web3.storage to store user data in a decentralized way.\nPart Ⅱ: CloudSlit-Provider (Network Miner, a Secure Network Tunnel Provider for Decentralized Data Private Retrieval) # Our nodes are automatically networked through kademlia DHT and IPFS networks of libp2p through peer discovery and routing, and data synchronization among multiple nodes is realized through PubSub function of libp2p.\nFor all users and Dao data, we use web3.storage of Filecoin to store user data in a decentralized way.\nPart Ⅲ: CloudSlit-Contracts (support:EVM Chains) # We provide a complete smart contract for the decentralized trusted bandwidth market. Our smart contract is deployed on the EVM network, and we provide many methods in the smart contract to ensure a safe trading process and a safe trading environment.\nPart Ⅳ: CloudSlit-verifier (Decentralized network quality checker) # We provide the verifier component for the decentralized trusted bandwidth market. Anyone can run the network verifier, monitor the network quality of ongoing orders, and detect and punish illegal and bad network providers.\nPart Ⅴ: DeCA (Decentralized PKI CA center) # Decentralize PKI CA center to provide communication authentication infrastructure for Dao point-to-point communication.\nPart Ⅵ: CloudSlit-Client (client for private data retrieval.) # A client user connects to a provider to establish a network security tunnel for private data retrieval.\nThanks supports # Protocol Labs Filecoin Nervos "},{"id":26,"href":"/cloudslit_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/tutorials/","title":"Tutorials","section":"CloudSlit-Fullnode","content":" Tutorials # "},{"id":27,"href":"/cloudslit_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/deploy/","title":"Deploy","section":"CloudSlit-Fullnode","content":" Deploy # "},{"id":28,"href":"/cloudslit_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/develop/","title":"Develop","section":"CloudSlit-Fullnode","content":" Develop # "},{"id":29,"href":"/cloudslit_docs/cloudslit/faqs/","title":"FAQs","section":"Overview","content":" FAQs # "},{"id":30,"href":"/cloudslit_docs/cloudslit/news/","title":"News","section":"Overview","content":" Record the bits and pieces of cloudslit. # "}]
