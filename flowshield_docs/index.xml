PKI consists of digital certificates managed by a certification authority (CA) to verify the identity of the user, thus providing a secure communication channel. However, the traditional PKI method has problems such as difficulty in mutual trust between multiple certification center nodes, single point of failure, and low efficiency.</description></item><item><title>NetWork</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/network/</guid><description> NetWork Details #</description></item><item><title>NetWork</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/network/</guid><description> NetWork Details #</description></item><item><title>NetWork</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/network/</guid><description> NetWork Details #</description></item><item><title>NetWork</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/network/</guid><description> NetWork Details #</description></item><item><title>NetWork</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/network/</guid><description>NetWork Details # DECA utilizes decentralized identity identification (DID) and verifiable claim (identity credential), supports key PKI functions, utilizes the immutable feature of offline storage (IPFS), effectively prevents third-party attacks, utilizes IPFS-CRDT synchronization strategy, enhances Concealed sharing, fast synchronization, and the use of blockchain to synchronize a small amount of basic information, greatly reducing the cost of consensus.
1.Apply for user identity DID: combine user certificate, verification method and other information according to the user&amp;rsquo;s basic identification.</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/storage/</guid><description> Storage Engine Details #</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-contracts/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-contracts/architecture/storage/</guid><description> Storage Engine Details #</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/storage/</guid><description> Storage Engine Details #</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/storage/</guid><description> Storage Engine Details #</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/storage/</guid><description> Storage Engine Details #</description></item><item><title>Storage</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/storage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/storage/</guid><description>Storage Engine Details # Centralized storage data is centralized, and the amount of data involved is larger, making the data more vulnerable to attacks and leaks. The security, privacy and sustainability of centrally stored data all present certain risks.
Data security includes two meanings: the first layer is &amp;ldquo;guarantee data privacy without leakage&amp;rdquo;, and the second layer is &amp;ldquo;guarantee the integrity of data without loss&amp;rdquo;.
In the current centralized storage mode, users upload all sensitive data, which not only makes users lose control over their own data, but also transfers the risk of data leakage to the cloud storage operator.</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-client/architecture/protocol/</guid><description> Protocol Details #</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-contracts/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-contracts/architecture/protocol/</guid><description> Protocol Details #</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-fullnode/architecture/protocol/</guid><description> Protocol Details #</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-provider/architecture/protocol/</guid><description> Protocol Details #</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/cloudslit-verifier/architecture/protocol/</guid><description> Protocol Details #</description></item><item><title>Protocol</title><link>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/protocol/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.flowshield.xyz/flowshield_docs/cloudslit/deca/architecture/protocol/</guid><description>Protocol Details # Current certificate systems protect online communications through the secure delivery of public keys, which correspond to identities, which use the corresponding secret private key to decrypt messages sent to them and prove that they sent messages (by signing them with the private key). Additionally users cannot be sure that their communications have not been compromised by fraudulent certificates that allow MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks, which are difficult to detect.</description></item></channel></rss>
